# Supply-chain-management project 

## Introduction 
Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of a business’ entire production flow, from sourcing raw materials to delivering a finished item.
The global supply chain is a complex network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, wholesalers and customers. SCM also involves the coordination of external partners and both internal resources and operations management. According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), “in essence, supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies.” 
This project focuses on analyzing production and stock data within the supply chain management framework. The primary objective is to identify trends, evaluate performance, and provide actionable insights to optimize production efficiency, improve stock management, and enhance quality control processes.
## Problem Statement 
Inefficiencies in production processes, unbalanced stock levels, and inconsistent inspection outcomes are affecting the overall performance of the supply chain. These issues lead to delays, increased costs, and missed revenue opportunities, making it crucial to identify and address the underlying problems effectively.
## Objectives
- Improve production efficiency by identifying regional and product-specific trends.
- Enhance stock management through better inspection outcomes and inventory practices.
- Maximize revenue by aligning production and inventory with demand trends.
- Provide actionable recommendations to streamline supply chain operations.
